                <h2>History of Elmina Castle (Ghana)</h2>
                <p>
                    Elmina Castle, also known as São Jorge da Mina, was built by the Portuguese in 1482 and is
                    the oldest European building in sub-Saharan Africa. It was originally a trading post for gold,
                    but by the 17th century, it became a major hub for the transatlantic slave trade. Enslaved
                    Africans were held in dark, overcrowded dungeons before being shipped to the Americas.

                    In 1637, the Dutch took over Elmina Castle and continued its use in the slave trade. Later,
                    in 1872, the British took control as part of their colonial expansion. After Ghana’s
                    independence in 1957, the castle became a national monument. Today, it is a UNESCO World
                    Heritage Site and a powerful symbol of remembrance, history, and healing.</p>

                <p>
                    Osu Castle, also known as Christiansborg Castle, is located in Accra, Ghana, and was
                    originally built by the Danes in the 1660s. It served as a trading post for gold, ivory, and
                    slaves. The castle changed hands several times—between the Danes, Portuguese, and Britishdue to
                    conflicts and sales.

                    In 1850, the British took permanent control, and it became the seat of government during
                    colonial rule. After Ghana’s independence in 1957, Osu Castle continued as the official
                    residence of Ghana's presidents until 2009.

                    Today, it is a historical site, symbolizing Ghana’s colonial past, slave trade legacy, and
                    political transformation over centuries. </p>

                <h2>Cape Coast Castel </h2>
                <p>
                    Cape Coast Castle, located in southern Ghana, was originally built by the Swedes in 1653 for
                    trade in timber and gold. It was later taken over by the British, who expanded it and turned it
                    into one of the largest slave-holding forts on the West African coast.

                    The castle played a major role in the transatlantic slave trade, where thousands of enslaved
                    Africans were kept in dungeons before being shipped to the Americas. It also served as the
                    headquarters of British colonial administration for a time.

                    After Ghana gained independence in 1957, Cape Coast Castle became a national monument.
                    Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, visited by people from around the world to reflect on
                    the history of slavery and colonialism.

                    <h2> Fort Victoria</h2>
                    <p>Fort Victoria, located in Cape Coast, Ghana, was originally known as Phipps Tower before being
                        rebuilt by the British in 1821 and renamed in honor of Queen Victoria. Unlike the larger castles
                        used in the transatlantic slave trade, Fort Victoria served primarily as a lookout and defensive
                        fortification. Perched on a hill, it provided a strategic vantage point to monitor both the
                        coastline and the surrounding area, offering protection for Cape Coast and its key trading
                        posts. The fort played a vital role in communication, acting as a signal post between other
                        nearby forts. Today, Fort Victoria stands as a historical monument and forms part of the UNESCO
                        World Heritage listing of forts and castles along the Ghanaian coast, attracting visitors with
                        its panoramic views and colonial legacy.

                    <h2> Fort James</h2>
                    <p>Fort James is a historic fort located in Jamestown, Accra, Ghana. Built by the British in
                        1673, it was one of several European trading posts established along the Gold Coast. Named
                        after King James II of England, the fort played a significant role in the transatlantic
                        slave trade, serving as a holding site for enslaved Africans before they were shipped
                        overseas. Over time, Fort James also functioned as a prison, famously housing Ghana’s first
                        president, Kwame Nkrumah, during the colonial era. Today, though no longer in use as a
                        prison, Fort James remains a powerful symbol of Ghana’s colonial past and is open to visitors as
                        a historical site. </p>
