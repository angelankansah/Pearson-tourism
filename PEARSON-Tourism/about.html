            <h2>About</h2>
            <P> Ghana is a vibrant destination known for its rich history, diverse culture, and welcoming spirit. Among
                its most significant heritage sites are the forts and castles that stretch along its coastline,
                including iconic landmarks like Cape Coast Castle, Elmina Castle, and Fort St. Jago. These structures
                are not only architectural marvels but also powerful symbols of Ghana’s past—playing a central role in
                global trade, European colonization, and the transatlantic slave trade. Today, they serve as important
                educational sites that preserve the memory of African resilience and the struggles of enslaved peoples.
                Beyond their historical value, these sites contribute to national identity, promote heritage tourism,
                and foster global conversations around human rights and reconciliation. This website is dedicated to
                exploring these forts and castles, highlighting their cultural, historical, and emotional significance
                while providing practical travel information for visitors seeking to connect with Ghana’s enduring
                legacy.
